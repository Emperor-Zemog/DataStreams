Hi my name is Valerie. I DM for a small group of players every weekend. Our campaign takes place in a fantasy world called nidus which is at a stage of technological development comparable with our world during the 20's and 30's. The campaign is set up to explore facism and racism using the fantasy setting as backdrop.
